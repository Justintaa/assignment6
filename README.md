# BarnesAndNoble Testing Automation

## Project Overview
This project is designed to test the `BarnesAndNoble` bookstore system, ensuring its functionality through **specification-based** and **structural-based** testing. The main goal of this project is to verify the correctness of the system's behavior and interactions with various components such as the book database and the book purchasing process.

Additionally, the project automates the testing and static analysis of the code using **GitHub Actions**, maintaining code quality and integrity throughout the development process.

## Technologies Used
- **Java** 
- **JUnit 5**
- **Mockito** 
- **GitHub Actions** 
- **Checkstyle** 
- **JaCoCo**

## Features
- **Automated Testing**
- **Static Analysis**
- **Code Coverage**
- **CI/CD Pipeline**
